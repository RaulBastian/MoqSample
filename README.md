# MoqSample
Moq sample

Sample console application applying topics learnt from Jason Robert's Pluralsight course:

Mocking with Moq 4 and xUnit
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/mocking-moq-xunit/table-of-contents

The aim is to apply everything learnt from the course as I gradually advance through it.

To do this, it simulates controllers which receive request and returns response DTO objects.

It applies logic and creates entities in a backed in memory dummy db context.

The controller has an external dependency on a service which is used to mock from the unit tests
